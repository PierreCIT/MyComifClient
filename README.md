## Description
Android application for the Comif' association of the Georges Charpak campus of the Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne. This application aims to allow users of the association to view the balance of their account and the products purchased.

## Details
The application contains mainly 2 screens : 
  - The main one which shows the balance of their Comif' account as well as of the amount of depenses of the day/week/month.
  - The details of all depenses with date, amount and details of the command (i.e. items purchased)

## How it works for first connexion users

At the first connexion user must specify the email address linked to the Comif's account previously creted by a Comif member. Then an email should be sent with a link to the ```reset password``` page of the Comif's website. There the user can set it's password to log into the app.</br>
Go back to the app and log using the email address and your new password.
